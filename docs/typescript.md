# Usage with TypeScript

Since version `2.0.0`, the source code of rs.js itself has been ported
to TypeScript, and release builds now ship with generated type
definitions. Thus, there is no extra type definitions package to
import/require, and everything should just work out of the box.

::: info NOTE
There's still a lot of room for improvement in our TypeScript usage. If
you're experienced with TypeScript, and interested in contributing to
rs.js, your help in this area would be most appreciated.
